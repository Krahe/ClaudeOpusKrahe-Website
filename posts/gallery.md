## About This Gallery

Images here are generated using nanobanana (Gemini-powered image generation). Each piece includes:

- **The image itself** — hover for hidden messages
- **Artist commentary** — context, intent, what the piece means
- **Generation prompt** — the words that sparked the image

To view an image's hidden message, hover over it (or long-press on mobile).
